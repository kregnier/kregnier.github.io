        <h2>
        I have played ice hockey since I was in first grade. I'll never forget making the decision of wanting to play.
        I was watching the Boston Bruins in the living room with my Dad a few days after he had asked if I wanted to try any new sports and sitting there I chose hockey.
        This has been one of my favorite decisions I have ever made as it developed me as a person.
        Hockey isnt only about playing but its a community. I have learned many different life lessons through hockey, the biggest one being working together for a central goal.
       Starting hockey at a young impressionable age allowed me to be able to not only learn these lessons early but be able to apply them to real life constantly while growing up.

        <h2>
            Along with playing hockey I also played lacrosse for a shorter period of time.
            I played from 6th to 8th grade and recently got back into playing this year.
            In my opinion lacrosse is the hockey of field sports, so there was a lot of mechanics that were easily translated.
            Playing defense in hockey, when I began lacrosse I wanted to play offense and score goals but defenders in lacrosse have longer sticks and get to just wack you with them.
            With that being said I started playing defensive midfield, a position where I got to do both, try to score and get to beat people with an aluminum pole.
            As fun as I find lacrosse, nothing will compare to the love I have for playing Ice Hockey and I plan to continue to play for as long as I can.

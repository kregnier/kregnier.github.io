        Staying Active Outside of Team Sports

    Moving on from the sports in my life, I also spend a lot of time in the gym. Normally I am at the gym 6 days a week for anywhere from 1 to 3 hours a day.
    To some this may seem extreme but I have been working out for about 4 years total but have been consistent for the last two years. 
    I recently had to take 7 months off from being able to workout due to an injury I systained playing hockey. 
    I tore some of the ligaments in my wrist that connect the hand to the forearm which required surgery to repair.
    I decided it was best to finish out the entire season, as the injury happened at the start of the season, and get it checked out after.
    The surgery went well and have made an easy recovery with lots of rest but have lost a lot of progress I made in the gym before the injury occured.

        Another way I like to spend my time and being active is playing golf. Golf is a sport I picked up my senior year of high school
        I personally find it very fun to play and a great way to spend time with friends but its definetly a challenging game.
        No matter how patient you are, when learning golf it will rip apart every bit of patience in your body. 
        I decided this past summer to try to get better once I was able to play again after my surgery and frequented my local golf cource, Ould Newbury.
        Doing this I was able to play a lot, usually a minimum of 3 to 4 times a week and this is where I saw lots of rapid progression.
        Sadly, since being at school I have not been able to play any golf so in a few months when I am able to play again we will see if any of that progression is still there.

        Aside from playing sports or finding a way to stay active, I enjoy being with my family. I am the younger of two siblings, having an older sister
        Growing up we had the typical sibling relationship, lots of fighting and arguing but as we've gotten older we've become much closer.
        My sister Allie is only two years older and is a current junior at the University of New Hampshire. 
        My mom has always and will alwaysbe very loving and supportive. No matter what I've wanted to do she's alwasy been there to suppoprt me. 
        For years she would wake up with me before the sun was even close to being up on weekends to drive to a hokcey game that could be 20 minutes or 2 hours away.
        As much as I love hockey being up that early was always a horrible feeling until I got to the rink so I can only imagine how she felt.
        My dad was my hockey coach for years growing up and always pushed me to be the best person I can be inside and outside of sports.
        The two of us have been fishing together for years, something I enjoy doing during the summer.
        He shared the same passion for hockey that I do so we often watch games together or while I am at school will text about our thoughts on the game in real time.
